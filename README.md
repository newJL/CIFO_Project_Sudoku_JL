README

Welcome to the repository for the Sudoku Solver using Genetic Algorithms. This repository contains the code for different configurations of the developed genetic algorithm (GA) to solve Sudoku puzzles, as well as the code to test and compare these configurations.

Contents

Here are the different configurations of the GA included in this repository:

1. sudoku_baseline: The baseline configuration of the Sudoku solver GA.
2. sudoku_roulette_wheel: Configuration using roulette wheel selection.
3. sudoku_roulette_wheel_NO_elitism: Configuration using roulette wheel selection without elitism.
4. sudoku_alternative_mutation_method: Configuration using an alternative mutation method.
5. sudoku_uniform_crossover: Configuration using uniform crossover.

Notes

- Each configuration file describes the specific setup used in the Sudoku solver GA.
- The benchmarking script provides detailed comparisons in terms of computational cost, fitness value, number of generations to reach the solution, and other relevant metrics.

Feel free to explore the code and use it to enhance the GA for solving Sudoku puzzles or for other combinatorial problems. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out.
